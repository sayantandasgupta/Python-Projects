### Rock Paper Scissor game in Python

This is a beginner-friendly side project that I have created in Python.

It is created using the properties of the <b>random</b> module in Python. 

Python version used: <b>3.9.5</b>

Feel free to fork and run this code on your machine.
It will give you a head start on :-

- <b>Conditional Statements ( if - elif- else )</b>
- <b>For Loop</b>
- <b>How to import and use external modules</b>

Enjoy 😄👍 !
